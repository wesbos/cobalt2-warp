# Cobalt2 for Warp

## Installing

To start, create a config directory in your home directory (if it's not already created):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes
```

Note that it may take several minutes for Warp to initially discover the new config directory.
You can either wait, or just restart the application.
After that step, all future changes to `~/.warp/themes` directory will be reflected in Warp within seconds.

Download the `cobalt2.yaml` file from this repo and copy it into the `themes` directory.

```sh
cp ~/cobalt2-warp/coblat2.yaml ~/.warp/themes
```

Open the Settings menu (top right corner or `âŒ˜-,`), and choose Select Theme. Cobalt2 should now be visible on the list of available themes. Click & confirm, and you're set!
